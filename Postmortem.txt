Initial Concept:
A defense type shooter game in which the player must defend the home base by defeating and blocking enemies. The enemies 
will spawn randomly from the top of the screen and the player must protect the base at the bottom of the screen. This game 
is not an infinite shooter and the player must return to the base to reload. When defeating enemies the corpses will become 
barriers that block incoming enemies. 

Controls:
	- WASD for player movement
	- space to reload (when in the reload area)
	// right click felt more intuitive; added option
	- Mouse (point and click) to aim and shoot

// original controls worked; no need for alternative solutions
// Alternatives:
// 	Q/E to aim (shoot straight from player position use keys to change angle of shot)+ mouse (space?) button to shoot
// 	arrow keys to move aiming crosshairs, shift/enter to shoot

Features:

	o limited bullet count
	o reload area
	o wall protecting home base
		o will take damage on impact from enemy
	o enemies will also die on impact, but will not leave a corpse
	o enemies defeated by player shooting will become corpses that block new enemies from progressing
	o new enemies will disappear if they hit a corpse
	o the corpse can take a few hits, but will eventually disappear too
		// currently takes one hit, did not have time to program durability yet

Would be nice to have:
	Timer
	High score based on time rather than enemies defeated
	o Start/Pause/Game Over Screen
		// Simple Game Over Banner added; player removed on Game Over
		// No start screen yet, Pause works (need to disable character movement)
		// will add more information to scenes in the future.
	o Sound/Particle effects when firing and on impact (bullet > enemy, enemy > wall etc.)
		// still need to add sound effects on collision with different objects
	x Increasing difficulty
	x increase in movement speed or durability of enemies

Development Tasks:

`Shooting: aim/fire method; test against stationary enemy
`Enemy Behavior: death behavior of enemies (shot vs collision death) and corpse behavior
`Home Base: Game Over State on collision by enemy
`Wall: damage on collision by enemy
`Reloading System: bullet limit and reload area, also need UI/UX for player convenience
	// simple ammo empty indicator implemented, but still need more complex UI
Other UI
High Score/Timer
Start/Pause/Game Over Screen
`Sound Effects
Art Assets (Particles and Enemy/Player Sprites)

I am satisfied with the character controls. In the original, there were a lot of problems and it did not feel nice to use either.
This version I spent time to adjust things so it should play nicely. The reload area was tricky for me to create, but when I finally
got it to work I feel like I learned a lot about triggers. I also struggled a bit with scenes. I wanted to organize it to use an
enum/switch case to switch between scenes, but it wasn't working well, so I loaded the scenes directly in the code where the switch
would be triggered. Currently the game over and pause scenes are very simple, and at one point I was thinking of not having scenes
and just having Text I could enable/diable using code. But in the future I want to add images and more complicated UI/UX, so I decided
to keep the scenes even if they weren't really necessary at the moment. For this project I tried to avoid looking at codes from the
internet. If I did google things I would directly go to the Unity documentation page for the scripts mentioned and tried to work it
out myself. I feel like this worked better than trying to change others' code to work for my specific case. I really like this simple
concept and I will continue to work on it in the future. I have some character/enemy concept art sketched out and am excited to add them 
in later.
